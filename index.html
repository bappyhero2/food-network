                <h4 class>Food and travel is a particularly compelling type of food blogging because it involves the
                    engagement of
                    different cultures. These bloggers travel around the globe, visiting and eating their way through
                    cities
                    known for food like Bangkok, Chengdu, and Tokyo</h4>

                <h5>For our simple and iconic shortcake, we discovered a great double-stacking technique that creates
                    super light and high biscuits that are easy to split. This makes them easy to fill without
                    crumbling. A simple recipe like this one allows its ingredients to shine, so use the very best
                    berries you can find.</h5>

                    <h5>Chana masala or chickpea curry, often called Amritsari Chole, originates from Punjab but is
                        popular all over India. There are many versions of this dish and every house has its own take on
                        it. This super authentic recipe features chickpeas smothered in a delicious thick, piquant and
                        spiced gravy.</h5>
